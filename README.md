# Crafting Interpreters

### Intro
I'm working through the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom as a side project to get more familiar with what is going on under the hood. I'm using this repo to keep track of the interpreters we build throughout the book and also to track my progress and thoughts as well.
